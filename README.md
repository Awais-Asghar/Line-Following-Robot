## Overview / Introduction

This project demonstrates a line-following robot built using an Arduino UNO and two infrared (IR) sensors. The robot detects the path (usually black line on a white surface) and follows it using logic-based decision-making. It controls two motors through a motor driver module and uses IR sensors to detect the black or white surface below.


## Features

- Follows a predefined black line on a white surface
- Real-time direction control using dual IR sensors
- Smart turn left/right or stop based on IR feedback
- Customizable speed settings for forward and turn
- Simple logic and easy-to-understand code


## Hardware Components

- Arduino UNO (1x)
- IR Sensor Modules (2x)
- L298N Motor Driver (1x)
- DC Motors (4x)
- Robot Chassis (1x)
- Wheels (4x)
- Jumper Wires
- Battery Pack (1x)


## IR Sensors (Infrared Sensors)

Infrared (IR) sensors are the primary components used for line detection in this robot. Each IR sensor module consists of:
- IR LED (Emitter) â€” Emits infrared light onto the surface.
- Photodiode/Phototransistor (Receiver) â€” Detects the reflected IR light.
  
### Working Principle:

- White surface reflects IR light â†’ Photodiode detects it â†’ Output is LOW
- Black line absorbs IR light â†’ Photodiode detects nothing â†’ Output is HIGH
- This difference in reflection allows the robot to detect where the black line is and respond accordingly.
- If both sensors see white â†’ go forward.
- If left sees white and right sees black â†’ turn left.
- If right sees white and left sees black â†’ turn right.
- If both see black â†’ stop.

## L298N Motor Driver

The **L298N Motor Driver Module** is used to control the two **DC motors** of the robot. It acts as an interface between the low-power Arduino and the high-power motors.

### Features:

- Can control the **direction and speed** of two DC motors.
- Accepts **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** signals from Arduino to adjust motor speed.
- Has two enable pins (**ENA, ENB**) and four control pins (**IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4**) connected to the Arduino.

### Working:

- **ENA / ENB**: Used to control the speed of motors via `analogWrite()`.
- **IN1/IN2** (for Motor A) and **IN3/IN4** (for Motor B): Used to control motor direction via `digitalWrite()`.

Example:

digitalWrite(IN1, HIGH);
digitalWrite(IN2, LOW);

## How to Charge Lithium-Ion

### What You Need:
- **TP4056 charging module** (with or without protection circuit)
- **Lithium-Ion battery** (typically 3.7V, like an 18650 cell)
- **Power source** (5V via USB cable or 5V adapter)

###  Wiring Connections

| TP4056 Pin | Connects To           | Description                      |
|------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **BAT+**   | Battery Positive (+)  | Connect to battery's positive terminal |
| **BAT-**   | Battery Negative (â€“)  | Connect to battery's negative terminal |
| **IN+**    | 5V Power Positive     | USB VCC or 5V adapter            |
| **IN-**    | 5V Power Ground       | USB GND or adapter GND           |
| **OUT+**   | Output Positive (Optional) | Same as BAT+ if present     |
| **OUT-**   | Output Negative (Optional) | Same as BATâ€“ if present     |


### Charging Status (LED Indicators)

- ðŸ”´ **Red LED ON** â†’ Charging
- ðŸŸ¢ **Blue/Green LED ON** â†’ Fully Charged (approx. 4.2V)

### TP4056 Specifications

- **Input Voltage:** 4.5V â€“ 5.5V (recommended: 5V)
- **Charging Cut-off Voltage:** 4.2V
- **Max Charging Current:** 1A (default, adjustable by changing onboard resistor)

### Charging Steps

1. Connect **BAT+** and **BAT-** to the Lithium-ion battery terminals.
2. Connect **IN+** and **IN-** to a 5V power supply (USB or adapter).
3. Observe LED indicators:
   - Red = Charging
   - Green/Blue = Fully Charged
4. Disconnect power once fully charged (unless using protected module).


### Safety Tips

-  Never leave charging unattended.
-  Use only **genuine 3.7V Li-ion batteries**.
-  Avoid **short circuits** on BAT terminals.
-  **Do not reverse polarity** â€” it can damage the module and the battery.
-  Use **TP4056 with protection** for safer charging and discharging.

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- USB drivers for Arduino
- Serial Monitor (for debugging)


## Pin Configuration

| Component             | Arduino Pin |
|----------------------|-------------|
| IR Left Sensor       | A1          |
| IR Right Sensor      | A0          |

## Decision Making Logic

The robot makes decisions based on the IR sensor input:

- **Both sensors LOW** â†’ Move **Forward**
- **Left LOW**, Right HIGH â†’ Turn **Left**
- **Left HIGH**, Right LOW â†’ Turn **Right**
- **Both HIGH** â†’ **Stop**


## Function Descriptions

- `moveForward()` â€” Moves robot forward by setting both motors in forward direction.
- `turnLeft()` â€” Rotates robot left by reversing the right motor and driving the left forward.
- `turnRight()` â€” Rotates robot right by reversing the left motor and driving the right forward.
- `stopMotors()` â€” Stops both motors immediately.
